# ====================
# NLP Extraction Layer — VoiceOps
#
# Responsibility (future phases):
#   - Text cleanup & normalization (pipeline step 3, per RULES.md §6)
#   - PII redaction (mandatory, pipeline step 4, per RULES.md §7)
#   - Intent detection with confidence & conditionality (per RULES.md §8.1)
#   - Financial-context sentiment detection (per RULES.md §8.2)
#   - Obligation strength classification (per RULES.md §8.3)
#   - Contradiction detection (per RULES.md §8.4)
#
# CRITICAL: All NLP signals MUST be derived ONLY from CUSTOMER speech (per RULES.md §5)
#
# Phase 0: Placeholder only. No logic implemented.
# TODO: Implement NLP extraction pipeline in a future phase.
