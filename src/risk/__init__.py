# =====================
# Risk & Fraud Signal Engine — VoiceOps
#
# Responsibility (future phases):
#   - Compute risk score (0–100) from multiple signals (per RULES.md §9)
#   - Determine fraud likelihood (low | medium | high)
#   - Inputs: intent, sentiment stability, obligation strength,
#     contradictions, audio trust signals, behavioral patterns
#   - Output key contributing risk factors
#
# Phase 0: Placeholder only. No logic implemented.
# TODO: Implement multi-signal risk scoring in a future phase.
